## About OfficeGear
I am thrilled to introduce my latest work - OfficeGear, a smart(not yetüòÖ) solution designed to enhance your health and productivity at the office. 

In today's fast-paced work environment, it's easy to neglect our basic health needs - staying hydrated and moving around. That's why I‚Äôve developed OfficeGear, a device that tracks your daily hydration levels and sedentary time, encouraging you to make healthier choices throughout your workday. üíßüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Discover OfficeGear

With OfficeGear, you can:
- Set personalized daily water intake goals. üí¶
- Customize sedentary time alerts, reminding you to stand up and move. üïí
- Track your progress with an intuitive display, akin to a battery charge bar, but for your health! üîã 

This tool is not just about tracking; it's about empowering office workers to stay hydrated and reduce prolonged sitting time, which are crucial for long-term health and well-being. üåø

#### Hardware components
- ESP32 WiFi Bluetooth Development Board from [LILYGO T-Display](https://www.lilygo.cc/en-pl/products/lilygo¬Æ-ttgo-t-display-1-14-inch-lcd-esp32-control-board)
- 3,7V 1100mAh Lithium Batterie from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/1100mAh-Schutzplatine-Isolierband-1-25-Stecker-ESP32-Entwicklungsplatine/dp/B087LTZW61/ref=asc_df_B087LTZW61/?tag=googshopde-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=427625050512&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=17111390587789641044&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1004234&hvtargid=pla-907068602140&psc=1&mcid=f0d3652e825f3c07a3478b6b864cf859&th=1&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=98992060069&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=427625050512&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=17111390587789641044&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1004234&hvtargid=pla-907068602140)


### User Interaction
Faced with the challenge of having only two buttons on this LILYGO T-Display board, a versatile navigation system is crafted, which leverages different menu contexts and button patterns‚Äîsingle click, double click, and long press to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience. <br>
