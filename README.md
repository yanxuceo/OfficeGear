## About OfficeGear
I am thrilled to introduce my latest work - OfficeGear, a smart(not yet😅) solution designed to enhance your health and productivity at the office. 

In today's fast-paced work environment, it's easy to neglect our basic health needs - staying hydrated and moving around. That's why I’ve developed OfficeGear, a device that tracks your daily hydration levels and sedentary time, encouraging you to make healthier choices throughout your workday. 💧🏃‍♂️

With OfficeGear, you can:

- Customize sedentary time alerts, reminding you to stand up and move. 🕒
- Track your progress with an intuitive display, akin to a battery charge bar, but for your health! 🔋 

This tool is not just about tracking; it's about empowering office workers to stay hydrated and reduce prolonged sitting time, which are crucial for long-term health and well-being. 🌿
